# AI-Powered-Neural-Pathway-Reconditioning (Cognitive-Audio-Modulation)

## Project Description
This project leverages real-time emotion recognition via facial analysis to deliver targeted subliminal auditory stimuli based on the userâ€™s current affective state. The left panel dynamically plays emotion-specific subliminals, designed to engage the subconscious mind and promote emotional regulation through neuroplastic reinforcement. Simultaneously, the right panel features an intelligent mental health chatbot, offering empathetic dialogue, cognitive restructuring support, and wellness guidance. This dual-panel system synergizes AI and psychological intervention, fostering real-time emotional balance and mental well-being.

## Theoretical Foundation
The scientific basis of this system lies in how cognitive and behavioral patterns are governed largely by the subconscious mind, which operates autonomously and stores deeply ingrained schemas and automatic processes. Subliminal auditory stimuli, perceived below the conscious threshold of awareness bypass the prefrontal cortex and directly engage the limbic system and implicit memory circuits. Repeated exposure facilitates neuroplasticity, enabling the restructuring of maladaptive cognitive frameworks and reinforcing adaptive behavioral conditioning. This process ultimately enhances self-efficacy, goal-directed behavior, and psychological resilience.

## Technical Summary
The system combines real-time emotion detection using Haarcascade and webcam input to classify emotions like Happy, Sad, or Angry. Based on the detected emotion, targeted stimuli are played using affective computing principles. A locally hosted, privacy focused mental health chatbot powered by the LLM, offers empathetic support. Flask connects the emotion and chatbot modules, while the frontend handles video, emotion display, audio, and chat UI.
